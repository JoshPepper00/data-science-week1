WEEK 2 CLEANING PLAN
====================
Name: Josh Pepper
Date: 03/02/2026

I've completed all 5 tutorials and application checklists.

Looking across all my checklists, these are the 2 most important issues 
to address in Week 2:
Format Strings in same way
Flag implausible numeric values

ISSUE 1 (Most Important)
-------------------------
Brief description: [What's the problem? 1 sentence]
inconsistent underscore use, capitalization and spelling
Which tutorial provides the solution: [Tutorial name/number]
3  Strings
Which variable(s) affected: [Variable name(s)]
site, treatment, collector
Why this is important to fix: [Biological/analytical reason]
can impact my ability to consolidate and analyse data accurately.
What I plan to do: [The technique I'll use, in plain English]
Convert all site names to uppercase and 
conditionally change the names of the values in the variables


ISSUE 2 (Second Most Important)
--------------------------------
Brief description: [What's the problem? 1 sentence]
there is a suspicious numeric variable (negative body mass values)
Which tutorial provides the solution: [Tutorial name/number]
7  Check Data Consistency
Which variable(s) affected: [Variable name(s)]
body_mass_mg
Why this is important to fix: [Biological/analytical reason]

Flag suspicious values and then summarise them
